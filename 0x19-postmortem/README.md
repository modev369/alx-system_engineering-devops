## Issue Summary

**Outage Duration:**  
The outage lasted from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM (GMT-5) on August 15th, 2023.

**Impact:**  
The user authentication service was completely unavailable, affecting approximately 25% of our users. These users were unable to log in to their accounts, leading to a significant drop in user activity and potential revenue loss during the outage.

**Root Cause:**  
The issue was caused by a database query optimization that unintentionally created a deadlock condition, preventing the authentication service from processing login requests.

## Timeline

- **3:00 PM (GMT-5) - Issue Detection:**  
  Monitoring alerts flagged a spike in failed authentication attempts, signaling a potential issue.
  
- **3:05 PM (GMT-5) - Initial Investigation:**  
  Database logs were examined, initially suspecting a DDoS attack due to the sudden surge in failed login attempts.

- **3:15 PM (GMT-5) - Misleading Assumptions:**  
  Focus shifted to network infrastructure and potential security breaches, which later proved to be unrelated to the issue.

- **3:45 PM (GMT-5) - Correct Diagnosis:**  
  Further analysis identified a deadlock in database queries as the root cause of the outage.

- **3:50 PM (GMT-5) - Escalation:**  
  The issue was escalated to the database management team for immediate resolution.

- **4:30 PM (GMT-5) - Resolution:**  
  The deadlock condition was resolved by rolling back the database query optimization and implementing a more robust deadlock detection mechanism.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The outage was triggered by a database query optimization that introduced a deadlock condition. This deadlock occurred when multiple database transactions were waiting on each other to release locks, effectively halting the authentication service.

**Resolution:**  
The deadlock was resolved by reverting the recent database query optimization to its previous state. Additionally, a deadlock detection and resolution mechanism was implemented in the database management system to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**  
To prevent similar incidents, the following measures will be taken:

- **Enhanced Testing:** Implement comprehensive testing protocols for database optimizations, with a focus on detecting potential deadlocks.
- **Improved Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring systems to promptly detect deadlock conditions and escalate issues more efficiently.
- **Refined Documentation:** Update documentation and communication protocols for critical system changes to ensure all teams are fully aware of potential risks.

**Tasks:**
1. Conduct a thorough review of all recent database optimizations to identify and address potential deadlock scenarios.
2. Implement additional monitoring specifically targeting database performance and deadlock conditions.
3. Patch the database management system to include the new deadlock detection and resolution mechanism.
4. Organize a post-incident review meeting to analyze the response and identify further areas for improvement.
